Each participant will focus on a specific pattern, particularly the Strategy Design Pattern, and implement a software solution for a suitable application exampleâ€”first naively without the pattern and then again using the pattern. Through these code examples, we will illustrate the advantages (and possibly disadvantages) of using the Strategy Pattern."
